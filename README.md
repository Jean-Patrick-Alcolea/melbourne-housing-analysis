## 🧠 Machine Learning

A Random Forest Regressor model was trained to predict house prices using features like:

- Rooms, Type, Distance, Bedroom, Bathroom, Car, Landsize

- Region name, Property count, and more

- ✅ Includes feature preprocessing and encoding
- ✅ Actual vs. Predicted price plot
- ✅ Scalable for future model improvements
